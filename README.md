This repository contains my complete implementation of the assessment, showcasing my skills as a front-end developer. The application is currently hosted at [kami-workforce](https://voluble-lolly-c9f556.netlify.app)

## Note

  

I created a new branch called [fixes-after-submission](https://github.com/perez247/kami_workforce_frontend_task/tree/fixes-after-submission). Due to the limited time for submission, I initially delivered a working MVP. This approach mirrors real-world scenarios where clients often expect a deliverable that can be iteratively improved.

  

Updates in the fixes-after-submission branch include:

  

- Smooth Sidebar animation

- Sidebar button icon animation

- Fixed remaining linting issues regarding the 'any' used

- Added test cases for some core business logics

  

I appreciate your understanding of my decision to prioritize timely delivery while continuing to improve the application. Kindly review the updates at your convenience.

## Development server

  

To start a local development server, run:

```bash

npm  install

ng  serve

```

  

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

  
  

## Architecture

  

The project follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture.

  

## Linting

  

Linting was performed, and several adjustments were made to improve code quality. However, there are two instances where the `any` type was used. Addressing these will require additional time and consideration, so they have been deferred for now.

  

```bash

npm  run  lint

```

  

## Testing

  

I am new to Angular testing, and as a result and was unable to successfully implement unit tests for this project. This is an area I am actively working to improve, and I am committed to learning best practices for writing tests in future projects.

  

To run the current test setup, use:

  

```bash

npm  run  test

```
