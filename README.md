# KAMI Workforce Front- End Developer Task

This repository contains my complete implementation of the assessment, showcasing my skills as a front-end developer. The application is currently hosted at [kami-workforce](https://voluble-lolly-c9f556.netlify.app)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:
```bash
ng  serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Architecture

The project follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture.

## Linting

Linting was performed, and several adjustments were made to improve code quality. However, there are two instances where the `any` type was used. Addressing these will require additional time and consideration, so they have been deferred for now.

```bash
npm run lint
```
  

## Testing

I am new to Angular testing, and as a result and was unable to successfully implement unit tests for this project. This is an area I am actively working to improve, and I am committed to learning best practices for writing tests in future projects.

To run the current test setup, use:

```bash
npm run test
```
